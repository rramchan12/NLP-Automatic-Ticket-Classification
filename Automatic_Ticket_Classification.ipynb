        "You need to build a model that is able to classify customer complaints based on the products/services. By doing so, you can segregate these tickets into their relevant categories and, therefore, help in the quick resolution of the issue.\n",

You can then use this data to train any supervised model such as logistic regression, decision tree or random forest. Using this trained model, you can classify any new customer complaint support ticket into its relevant department."

It turned the agent was giving me the wrong information in order to upgrade the account. XXXX   changed my anniversary date from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX without my consent!

I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.\n",

On Thursday XX/XX/2019 I went into A branch after being advised by a customer service representative that my account would actually be closed. I went into the branch to see how I can remove the funds that are in there currently in as well as if my direct deposit from my place of employment would be returned. The bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would Post but they may take an additional business day. That Saturday I attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on Friday, XX/XX/2019. Upon looking at my account I realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement. Ive been called and I was told that it may take two business day stating Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only. Now, Chase is informing me that I will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently. Unfortunately, This has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments, etc. I am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that I have peace of mind in fact Chase has handled my situation grossly I even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself. Although I know that Chase reserves the right to close my account at any time I do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document. I am not being a shored or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that I have peace of mind in fact Chase has handled my situation grossly I even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself. Although I know that Chase reserves the right to close my account at any time I do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document. This situation is truly affecting my livelihood and they dont seem to want to deal with Me professionally. Thank you\n",

Therefore, I request a one month payment extension with my Auto Loan Company, Chase. For the past almost fours years, my request for payment extension is granted. I have never been delinquent with my auto loan payment. However, On XX/XX/2019 my request for a one month payment extension was denied this year. I explained my situation to representative and the supervisor with no avail. After a lengthy discussion and waiting, I was informed the reason for the decline as it is not \" contractual ''. This reason for denial baffled me and therefore I emailed the office of XXXX XXXX Executive Director, Communications, JPMorgan Chase & Co. A representative contacted me and stated Chase will follow-up. About week later a representative of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX office called. The representative shared her role was help resolve the matter. The representative via conference call contacted the department handing my request. After, reviewing my information my request was still denied based on \" policy changes ''. I requested an explanation and representative stated a letter will be mailed with explanation. I have received XXXX letters the reason for denial was not \" policy changes ''. I would like CFPB help in exploring the denial of my payment extension request especially since I have been clear reason for denial.\n",
            "21    On XXXX XX/XX/2019, I made a {$300.00} payment to an online retailer using Chase quick pay with XXXX on the Chase website. I realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation, product, or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted Chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank. \\n\\nI contacted Chase via a secured message on XX/XX/2019 explaining what happened and asked \" Is there a way to reverse this transaction, or do you have a contact at XXXX that can give me more information about the recipient? '' That XXXX, my message was reviewed and I received a response restating my original email and informing me that \" The transfer has been completed. However, as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email, some require the expertise of another team. In order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our Consumer Online Technical Support Team. '' I called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department. I was directed to call XXXX and ask them about the transaction because Chase did not have any information outside of what I provided when initiating the transfer. I felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and I had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at XXXX and didn't have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask XXXX or what words and phrases I should use to get the information I was looking for. \\n\\nI called XXXX who's automated system initially directed me to call my bank because I used the banks app to initiate the transaction. I called XXXX again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent. They told me that all of the information about the transaction would in Chase 's system because I used the banks app to perform the transaction. She stayed on the line with me until I understood everything that I should ask and had a better understanding of the situation. I ended the call and called chase again. \\n\\nWhen I called chase the second time, the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information. She then asked me why I needed this information and I explained my situation again. I was once again transferred to the claims department, who told me that I needed to contact XXXX to get the information I was looking for. After I told her that I had already contacted them, she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured. She said that Chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that I inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system. In both phone calls, they asked if I initiated that transaction, and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter. \\n\\nDuring this whole process, it felt like Chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation. These transactions are advertised as a \" fast, safe and easy way to send money, '' but seem to be a dangerous way to do business. I feel deceived by Chase 's advertising and further victimized by the way I was treated by the members on their customer service team.\n",

              "78310    i am not familiar with xxxx pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumers i believed this to be safe as it was through my chase bank app i have been with chase for almost  years and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful i am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant has refused to answer my inquiries and now shut down communication the website of the said merchant looks entirely legitamite and is even using the faces of highly successful brands with individuals linked to their social media without their consent in performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through pi it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holders to perpetuate this cycle of fraud furthermore as this is a non fixed voip being used i believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real xxxx xxxx chase bank told me they wouldnt even investigate report this to xxxx or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter there isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet the chase mobile app verbiage makes a point to deceptively position this app as under the branch of chase banking service and as such imply a degree of entitlement to its customer service protection protocols chase has your back which reads on the very same link as the xxxx tab  is most certainly not true this places consumers at risk when using this mobile service and does not flag the concern of chase in the slightest at minimum the risk of using xxxx on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public as it stands to be potentially devastating i have plans to file reports with all corresponding authorities as well as notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him i also intend to urge my neighbor who works in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using xxxx and xxxx integrated banking apps to the public i understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such as chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that needs to be disclosed more throughly i would not have clicked on the to link to the extent i did if i would have been better informed\n",

advised by a customer service representative that my account would actually be closed i went into the branch to see how i can remove the funds that are in there currently in as well as if my direct deposit from my place of employment would be returned the bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would post but they may take an additional business day that saturday i attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on friday  upon looking at my account i realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement ive been called and i was told that it may take two business day stating tuesday xxxxxxxx would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only now chase is informing me that i will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently unfortunately this has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments etc i am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself although i know that chase reserves the right to close my account at any time i do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document i am not being a shored or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself although i know that chase reserves the right to close my account at any time i do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document this situation is truly affecting my livelihood and they dont seem to want to deal with me professionally thank you  ...

with the innocuous title  important information regarding changes to your chase account   they often use similar titles for ads and other communications  \\n\\nin it they force me into binding arbitration  despite that never being something i had agreed to and never being a part of any contract between me and them  \\n\\nthey do include a method to opt out but have no additional information about the consequences  many other people ive seen who have had a similar problem are afraid that chase will close their account if they opt out  and even more egregiously despite chase simply sending an email doing this they require me to mail them a letter with my personal information enclosed in order to opt out \\n\\nthis is clearly less secure and a massive loss of both my time and money that

                                   on xxxx  i made a  payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with xxxx on the chase website i realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank \\n\\ni contacted chase via a secured message on  explaining what happened and asked  is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at xxxx that can give me more information about the recipient  that xxxx my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that  the transfer has been completed however as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team  i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department i was directed to call xxxx and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask xxxx or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for \\n\\ni called xxxx whos automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction i called xxxx again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again \\n\\nwhen i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i was once again transferred to the claims department who told me that i needed to contact xxxx to get the information i was looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system in both phone calls they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter \\n\\nduring this whole process it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transactions are advertised as a  fast safe and easy way to send money  but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team  ...

of  on xxxxxxxx and  on xxxxxxxx the minimum payment was  the closing date was xxxxxxxx  please see attached statement  that statement  xxxxxxxx  shows that i had an outstanding purchase balance of  on xxxxxxxx i have enclosed the previous months statement to show that there were no other purchases prior to the one on xxxxxxxx \\nhowever when i got the xxxx statement it shows that i still have a purchase balance of  i have a promotional balance xxxx  in xxxx of  in xxxx the promotional balance was   a difference of  \\n\\napparently the payment  above the minimum payment required by chase  i thought would be applied to the purchase     was applied to the promotional balance first it is my understanding that once the minimum payment has been met payments in excess of the minimum would be applied to the highest interest rate balance first this is not the first time that chase has skirted us financial law to turn a larger profit i need help in rectifying this problem because my logic fell on deaf ears at chase thank you in advance for your assistance \\n\\nrespectfully xxxx xxxx xxxx  ...

bank why they reported to the credit bureau that i was  days late on a payment that was already paid off when i called i got this info  they showed that on the xxxx of  i was very late on my bill and owed xxxx to bring this balance down to xxxx and be finished with the bill i paid that amount on the same day the xxxx to being it to xxxx \\n\\nthey say that i tried to make another payment for  later that same day and in a few days that came back as a return payment \\n\\nthe man on the phone stated to me that if the payment went through then it would have meant that i had a credit on my account for xxxx since i didnt owe anything \\n\\nthey updated my account with charges and late fees from the return payment that i had no idea of since i thought i paid off the entire amount they reported to the credit bureau that i was  days late for not paying what accrued to be  the guy representing chase agreed with me that they were in the wrong for charging me the fees and said they would remove them i still have  in the negative that they are saying that i owe in the mobile app \\n\\nadditionally because they reported me being late my credit score dropped  points when i called back to ask if they can report that they made a mistake they said i would have to do that on my own i think thats xxxx  ...

withdrew money to pay for another property that i do not own or has any connection with me or my account \\n\\nthis left me in an escrow shortage and they have adjusted my monthly payment to reflect this as well i called to explain their mistake and they took two weeks but finally managed to remove the incorrect parcel from my account \\n\\nhowever they are not refunding the erroneous tax payment they made from my escrow account and are instead  waiting  for the local municipality to refund the money \\n\\nfrom my perspective chase without my immediate knowledge or permission has misappropriated funds from my escrow account and now i am stuck footing the bill until they get the money back  ...

advised by a customer service representative that my account would actually be closed i went into the branch to see how i can remove the funds that are in there currently in as well as if my direct deposit from my place of employment would be returned the bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would post but they may take an additional business day that saturday i attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on friday  upon looking at my account i realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement ive been called and i was told that it may take two business day stating tuesday xxxxxxxx would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only now chase is informing me that i will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently unfortunately this has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments etc i am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself although i know that chase reserves the right to close my account at any time i do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document i am not being a shored or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious

                                   on xxxx  i made a  payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with xxxx on the chase website i realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank \\n\\ni contacted chase via a secured message on  explaining what happened and asked  is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at xxxx that can give me more information about the recipient  that xxxx my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that  the transfer has been completed however as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team  i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department i was directed to call xxxx and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask xxxx or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for \\n\\ni called xxxx whos automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction i called xxxx again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again \\n\\nwhen i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i was once again transferred to the claims department who told me that i needed to contact xxxx to get the information i was looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system in both phone calls they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter \\n\\nduring this whole process it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of

with the innocuous title  important information regarding changes to your chase account   they often use similar titles for ads and other communications  \\n\\nin it they force me into binding arbitration  despite that never being something i had agreed to and never being a part of any contract between me and them  \\n\\nthey do include a method to opt out but have no additional information about the consequences  many other people ive seen who have had a similar problem are afraid that chase will close their account if they opt out  and even more egregiously despite chase simply sending an email doing this they require me to mail them a letter with my personal information enclosed in order to opt out \\n\\nthis is clearly less secure and a massive loss of both my time and money that is clearly being used solely to dissuade people from opting out \\n\\nthis is blatant malpractice by chase  ...     3\n",

purchase balance of  i have a promotional balance xxxx  in xxxx of  in xxxx the promotional balance was   a difference of  \\n\\napparently the payment  above the minimum payment required by chase  i

bank why they reported to the credit bureau that i was  days late on a payment that was already paid off when i called i got this info  they showed that on the xxxx of  i was very late on my bill and owed xxxx to bring this balance down to xxxx and be finished with the bill i paid that amount on the same day the xxxx to being it to xxxx \\n\\nthey say that i tried to make another payment for  later that same day and in a few days that came back as a return payment \\n\\nthe man on the phone stated to me that if the payment went through then it would have meant that i had a credit on my account for xxxx since i didnt owe anything \\n\\nthey updated my account with charges and late fees from the return payment that i had no idea of since i thought i paid off the entire amount they reported to the credit bureau that i was  days late for not paying what accrued to be  the guy representing chase agreed with me that they were in the wrong for charging me the fees and said they would remove them i still have  in the negative that they are saying that i owe in the mobile app \\n\\nadditionally because they reported me being late my credit score dropped  points when i called back to ask if they can report that they made a mistake they said i would have to do that on my own i think thats xxxx  ...     5\n",

withdrew money to pay for another property that i do not own or has any connection with me or my account \\n\\nthis left me in an escrow shortage and they have adjusted my monthly payment to reflect this as well i called to explain their mistake and they took two weeks but finally managed to remove the incorrect parcel from my account \\n\\nhowever they are not refunding the erroneous tax payment they made from my escrow account and are instead  waiting  for the local municipality to refund the money \\n\\nfrom my perspective chase without my immediate knowledge or permission has misappropriated funds from my escrow account and now i am stuck footing the bill until they get the money back  ...     5\n",

i put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made i immediately contacted xxxx and was referred to chase bank i then immediately contacted chase bank within no more than  of getting the notification on the screen and i was told by the chase representative i spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why i asked for more information about the xxxx  offer and she explained that even if i had been approved the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket i then explicitly told her i was glad i got denied and i was absolutely no longer interested in the account i asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged this all happened no later than  after putting in the application on  notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what i was told by the chase representative chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on  this is now being reported in my credit report and chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which i did not consent to and out of their error      2\n",

advised by a customer service representative that my account would actually be closed i went into the branch to see how i can remove the funds that are in there currently in as well as if my direct deposit from my place of employment would be returned the bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would post but they may take an additional business day that saturday i attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on friday  upon looking at my account i realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement ive been called and i was told that it may take two business day stating tuesday xxxxxxxx would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only now chase is informing me that i will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently unfortunately this has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments etc i am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself although i know that chase reserves the right to close my account at any time i do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document i am not being a shored or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself although i know that chase reserves the right to close my account at any time i do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document this situation is truly affecting my livelihood and they dont seem to want to deal with me professionally thank you      1\n",

                                   on xxxx  i made a  payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with xxxx on the chase website i realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank \\n\\ni contacted chase via a secured message on  explaining what happened and asked  is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at xxxx that can give me more information about the recipient  that xxxx my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that  the transfer has been completed however as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team  i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department i was directed to call xxxx and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask xxxx or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for \\n\\ni called xxxx whos automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction i called xxxx again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again \\n\\nwhen i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i was once again transferred to the claims department who told me that i needed to contact xxxx to get the information i was looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system in both phone calls they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter \\n\\nduring this whole process it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transactions are advertised as a  fast safe and easy way to send money  but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team      4\n",

fees i have alert of low balance or unsuficent fee balance and always deposit immediatly to cover transactions if needed but chase always changed the order and charged me overdraft fee anyway when you call they said their per their guidelines they dont refund more then  overdrawft doesnt matter bank fault or not\\n\\ntaken  from people is money just because you can is not ok\\n\\nsee attached documents when chase refund they always find the way to take back what they refunded in first place      4\n",

and the other user on my account i responded that i did not have a savings and i am only authorized user customer rep told me they would call me back in  minutes to keep the line open i didnt receive a call back after an hour so i contacted chase from the first call i thought someone was using my card fraudulently i spoke to the rep who transferred me to a supervisor xxxx who said the card was activated and the transaction would process called the catering company and card was declined i then used my xxxx  xxxx card to pay for the order xxxx xxxx texted me asking if i was authorizing purchase and i responded yes contacted caterer and xxxx  xxxx was declined i contacted chase again spoke to rep was told the initial questions are used to trick people to see what there answer would be she told me the cvv code was incorrectly being input by the caterer and i responded that i had gone over the numbers and cvv used was correct she told me the card was cleared for the purchase and she would monitor it for  hours called caterer  card declined use a mastercard  which processed went to use chase amazon at restaurant at xxxx pm tonight in the amount of   it was declined i was told by chase i was not over limit still frustrated figuring out multiple declines after several conversations with chase stating the card would be ok to use embarrassed as the caterer kept suggesting i was over my limit which i pay my card in full every month and chase confirmed that i was under my limit with the  transaction never been declined by either chase or xxxx  xxxx before  today after multiple assurances that i was all set and card would be monitored to make sure transaction would clear  it never did      4\n",

with the innocuous title  important information regarding changes to your chase account   they often use similar titles for ads and other communications  \\n\\nin it they force me into binding arbitration  despite that never being something i had agreed to and never being a part of any contract between me and them  \\n\\nthey do include a method to opt out but have no additional information about the consequences  many other people ive seen who have had a similar problem are afraid that chase will close their account if they opt out  and even more egregiously despite chase simply sending an email doing this they require me to mail them a letter with my personal information enclosed in order to opt out \\n\\nthis is clearly less secure and a massive loss of both my time and money that is clearly being used solely to dissuade people from opting out \\n\\nthis is blatant malpractice by chase      3\n",

of  on xxxxxxxx and  on xxxxxxxx the minimum payment was  the closing date was xxxxxxxx  please see attached statement  that statement  xxxxxxxx  shows that i had an outstanding purchase balance of  on xxxxxxxx i have enclosed the previous months statement to show that there were no other purchases prior to the one on xxxxxxxx \\nhowever when i got the xxxx statement it shows that i still have a purchase balance of  i have a promotional balance xxxx  in xxxx of  in xxxx the promotional balance was   a difference of  \\n\\napparently the payment  above the minimum payment required by chase  i thought would be applied to the purchase     was applied to the promotional balance first it is my understanding that once the minimum payment has been met payments in excess of the minimum would be applied to the highest interest rate balance first this is not the first time that chase has skirted us financial law to turn a larger profit i need help in rectifying this problem because my logic fell on deaf ears at chase thank you in advance for your assistance \\n\\nrespectfully xxxx xxxx xxxx      5\n",

bank why they reported to the credit bureau that i was  days late on a payment that was already paid off when i called i got this info  they showed that on the xxxx of  i was very late on my bill and owed xxxx to bring this balance down to xxxx and be finished with the bill i paid that amount on the same day the xxxx to being it to xxxx \\n\\nthey say that i tried to make another payment for  later that same day and in a few days that came back as a return payment \\n\\nthe man on the phone stated to me that if the payment went through then it would have meant that i had a credit on my account for xxxx since i didnt owe anything \\n\\nthey updated my account with charges and late fees from the return payment that i had no idea of since i thought i paid off the entire amount they reported to the credit bureau that i was  days late for not paying what accrued to be  the guy representing chase agreed with me that they were in the wrong for charging me the fees and said they would remove them i still have  in the negative that they are saying that i owe in the mobile app \\n\\nadditionally because they reported me being late my credit score dropped  points when i called back to ask if they can report that they made a mistake they said i would have to do that on my own i think thats xxxx      5\n",

withdrew money to pay for another property that i do not own or has any connection with me or my account \\n\\nthis left me in an escrow shortage and they have adjusted my monthly payment to reflect this as well i called to explain their mistake and they took two weeks but finally managed to remove the incorrect parcel from my account \\n\\nhowever they are not refunding the erroneous tax payment they made from my escrow account and are instead  waiting  for the local municipality to refund the money \\n\\nfrom my perspective chase without my immediate knowledge or permission has misappropriated funds from my escrow account and now i am stuck footing the bill until they get the money back      5"
