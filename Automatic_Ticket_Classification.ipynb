I am asking the bank to validate the debt. Instead I been receiving mail every month from them attempting to collect a debt. \\nI have a right to know this information as a consumer. \\n\\nChase account # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Thanks in advance for your help.\n",

On XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased three high school textbooks for my XXXX year old daughter because she transferred to a new school. All three books were damaged when a water bottle in her backpack broke. The Chase representative assured me the textbooks would be covered and instructed me to file a claim at XXXX. I immediately went to the website and filed the claim, including uploading all of the requested paperwork which included a copy of my credit card statement, copies of the three receipts and photographic evidence of the damage. The website even had \" books '' as one of the catagories I could list as the type of item they cover and that I could make a claim on. After following up repeatedly on my claim since the insurance provider failed to \" review my information and contact me within 5 business days to outline the next steps of the process, '' as outlined in an email I received acknowledging my claim submission, I called to complain. The representative said claims are not looked at by an examiner \" for eight to ten days '' and then it would take \" two days to actually review the claim. '' I responded that this information was contradictory to the information provided in writing in the email XXXX sent to me, and she said that she is not an adjuster and that is how it works. I then asked to speak with an adjuster and she agreed to connect me to one. I was then put on hold and when she returned, she said my file had \" just been updated while I was on hold and that the claim was being denied because textbooks have finite lives and are undergo revision after courses end. '' I explained that my daughter 's course had not ended and that I was told specifically by Chase that my textbook purchases would be covered and was again told they were refusing my claim. '' By the time the call ended I received an email stating that my claim status had been updated and was being denied. I find this completely outrageous and borderline fraudulent.\n",
              "78310    I am not familiar with XXXX pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumers. I believed this to be safe as it was through my Chase bank app. I have been with Chase for almost 20 years and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful. I am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant has refused to answer my inquiries and now shut down communication. The website of the said merchant looks entirely legitamite and is even using the faces of highly successful brands with individuals linked to their social media without their consent. In performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through PI it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holders to perpetuate this cycle of fraud. Furthermore as this is a non fixed voip being used I believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real XXXX XXXX Chase Bank told me they wouldnt even investigate, report this to XXXX or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter. There isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet! The chase mobile app verbiage makes a point to deceptively position this app as under the branch of Chase banking service and as such, imply a degree of entitlement to its customer service protection protocols. Chase has your back which reads on the very same link as the XXXX tab ... .is most certainly not true. This places consumers at risk when using this mobile service and does not flag the concern of Chase in the slightest. At minimum the risk of using XXXX on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public as it stands to be potentially devastating I have plans to file reports with all corresponding authorities as well as notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him. I also intend to urge My neighbor who works in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using XXXX and XXXX integrated banking apps to the public. I understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such as Chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that needs to Be disclosed more throughly. I would not have clicked on the to link to the extent I did if I would have been better informed.\n",
              "78311                                                                                                                                                        I have had flawless credit for 30 yrs. I've had Chase credit cards, \" Chase Freedom '' specifically since XXXX with no problems ever. I've done many balance transfers in my life, so I have plenty of experience. I recently did a balance transfer with Chase Freedom for {$9000.00} ( did many with other Chase cards, but apparently not \" Freeedom '' ) When I got my first bill, my minimum payment was {$470.00}. I was SHOCKED. I immediately called on XX/XX/XXXX. The representative told me that the min payment was so high bc they were making me pay the \" Balance transfer fee '' up front, but my future payments would be around {$90.00}, 1 % of total balance ( which is standard, AND the rate THEY ADVERTISE ) I went to pay the next payment on XX/XX/XXXX & was once again SHOCKED to see my minimum payment was {$440.00}. I paid it, but I have been trying to work this out with Chase ever since. Apparently, the representative was WRONG & I am actually expected to pay 5 %, instead of the standard 1 % they normally charge, bc that was written in my \" user agreement '' paperwork back in XX/XX/XXXX!! 28 years ago!!! They currently charge 1 % to everyone else in the world. My other cards, including Chase, are all 1 %. This {$440.00} is an unreasonable amt to expect someone to pay for 1 credit card. I have kids & many other bills to pay. They never warned me they were so \" off the charts '' with their minimum payment percentage, ( except for my original paperwork in XX/XX/XXXX ). They offer everyone else 1 % terms. They change THEIR \" terms '' anytime it benefits THEM, but won't budge to lower it to make this payment more affordable & reasonable. So, I also asked them ( as soon as I found this out ) to refund my {$360.00} transfer fee so I could use it to transfer the balance to a different card with a more reasonable minimum payment. They refused. I also asked if they would transfer to my CHASE SLATE card, which has 1 % min pmt, they also refused. They will not work with me at all. I am a responsible working person. I would like to preserve my good credit. I could easily transfer again to a different card, but I'd have to pay another lump sum of $ again.\n",

I did that to close out my account roughly {$500.00} payment when I closed out the accounts, and now I get this late payment that showed up on my credit report after 10+ years stating I owe close to {$900.00} dollars. I have never had any payment schedules or notifications in the 10+ years because I paid it off. Upon calling them I am told I need to show proof I paid it off. I would like to think that if indeed I had not paid it off ( which I did ) I would have immediately received late payment notifications. I left Chase bank because of some poor customer service and charges that were way out of line with the other banking institutions.\n",
